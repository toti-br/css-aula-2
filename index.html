      <h1>How does science work? It’s all about clones!</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">The role of statistical reasoning in science</h2>
      <p id="paragrafo">Every good scientific experiment that seeks to establish how something works — and not just that it does work — is about making clones.</p>
      <p>Huh?</p>
      <p>Bear with me.</p>

      <h3>Thinking scientifically</h3>
      <p>Let’s arm wrestle! To prepare, you drink a dram of Strength Potion (TM) while I drink filtered water. Then you defeat me without breaking a sweat. You won because of the potion, right?</p>
      <p>Nope, we’d offend science itself if we jumped to that conclusion. After all, we’re different people with different arms. Since we could come up with a thousand potion-free explanations for your victory, we’d look foolish claiming we know anything at all about the potion’s efficacy.</p>
      <p>But what if I arm-wrestled my genetic clone? She drinks the potion and I don’t. Then she wins effortlessly. Is it the potion?</p>
